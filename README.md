# dsp-learning

A bunch of resources I've come across (randomly, searching, or recommended) that I think might be useful for learning DSP concepts.

Eventually I want to organize this repo in a few different ways: beginner-to-advanced, and by-topic. I'll do that as I get more resources though.

Please let me know if there are any broken links!

## Resources

 - [IIR History](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~shunsun/resource/IIR_History.pdf)
    - Talks about the changes in "best practice" between FIR/IIR filters, it has a lot to do with available optimizations.
    - "The auther (Rader) is a DSP legend."
 - **Effect Design** by Jon Dattorro
    - [Part 1: Reverberator and Other Filters](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart1.pdf)
    - [Part 2: Delay-Line Modulation and Chorus](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart2.pdf)
    - [Part 3: Oscillators: Sinusoidal and Pseudonoise](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart3.pdf)
